# Stripe website rebuild

This is a self practice of rebuilding the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) new website with Pug, Sass and Gulp for task automation.

### Note
Use [Pug and Sass starter project](https://github.com/azemoh/gulp-pug-sass-starter) for task automation.

### This project uses:

1. [browser-sync](https://github.com/browsersync/browser-sync) to launch a local server and do live reloads as sass and pug files changes
2. [gulp-pug](https://github.com/jamen/gulp-pug) to compile pug files.
3. [gulp-data](https://github.com/colynb/gulp-data) to pass data to pug. this project uses JSON as the data source, however you can generate data objects from a variety of sources: json, front-matter, database, etc... see gulp-data [README](https://github.com/colynb/gulp-data)
4. [gulp-sass](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass) to compile sass files.
5. [gulp-autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-autoprefixer) to add vendor prefixes to css files
